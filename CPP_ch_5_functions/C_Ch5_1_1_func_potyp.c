    ----------|    PROTOTYPE    |----------
        The general form of a function prototype:

            type function_name(	type parameter_name1,
                                type parameter_name2,
                                . . . . .
                                type parameter_nameN);


        A prototype declares 'three attributes' associated with a function:
            1.	Its return type.
            2.	The number of   its  parameters.
            3.	The type of   its   parameters. 




    ----------|    Arguments and Parameters    |----------
        Let average(int a, int b, int c) is a function. 

        parameters:
            In the declaration of this function i.e. its prototype , eg: 
                int average(int a, int b, int c); 
            the variable list with their data types "int a, int b, int c" is the parameter list. 
            Parameter lists is also used in function definition 
            ('function declaration'/prototype declaration can be replaced by 'definition' in small program cases).

        Arguments:
            Arguments of a function are the variable list (or direct data list)  which is used in calling the function. Eg:  
                average(x, y, z) 
                    or 
                average(2, 4, 5) 
            in function arguments no data type declaration is required.




    ----------|    what a prototype does    |----------
            Prototypes inform the compiler about the return type of a function. Because, different data types have different sizes.
                If a function is not prototyped, the compiler will simply assume that it is returning an "integer". 
                If it is returning some other type, an error will occur. 
                    If the function is in the same file as the rest of your program, then the compiler will catch this error. 
                    But if the function is in another file or a library, then the error will go uncaught and lead to trouble when the program is executed.

            Prototypes allow the compiler to find and report illegal type conversions between 
                the type of arguments used to call a function and the type definition of its parameters.
                For example, you cannot convert an integer into a pointer.

            Prototypes enables the compiler to report when 
                the number of arguments passed to a function is not the same as the number of parameters declared.
            
            


    ----------|    Variable Length Argument    |----------
        Allows a function to receive any number of arguments.
            Variable number of arguments are represented by THREE DOTES "..."
            It requires the header file STDARG.H .

        Following specifies a function that has one integer parameter and a variable number of other parameters.
            int myfunc(int a, ...);

        Both printf() and seanf() accept a variable number of arguments.
 */



/* 
    ----------|    DEFINITION & DECLARATION of a Function    |----------

    A declaration specifies the type of an object. 
    A definition causes storage for an object to be created.

    A prototype is a declaration. The function, itself, which contains the body of the function is a definition.

    It is legal to fully DEFINE A FUNCTION prior to its first use, thus eliminating the need for a "separate prototype".
        However, this works only in very small programs. For example: 
*/  

#include<stdio.h>
//No PROTOTYPE is required, only DEFINATION
void line (void){	
    int i; 
    
    for(i=0; i<80; i++) printf(".");	
} 

int main(void){ 
    line(); 
    return 0;
}
 
// Remember that if a function does not return a value, then its return type should be specified as void-both in its definition and in its prototype .




/*  
    ----------|    Problems when prototype is not present    |----------
    OLD-Fashioned FORWARD DECLARATION: 
    In early versions of C, before prototypes were invented, it was still necessary to tell the compiler about the return type of a function.
    This was done using a forward declaration. 

    A forward declaration is essentially truncated form of a "prototype" that declares "only the return type" of a function
        not the type and number of its parameters. Compilers still allow this type of declarations. 
    
    when a function declaration occurs without a parameter list. It might have parameters, it might not.

    When a non-prototyped function is called, all integral promotions take place.
        when a "prototype" exists, the types specified in the prototype are maintained, and no type promotions will occur.
*/




/* Example 1: The following program demonstrates an old-style "FORWARD DECLARATION", 
                It uses it to inform the compiler of volume()'s return type.

                Since the old-style declaration does not inform the compiler about any of volume()'s parameters it is "not a function prototype".
                    This will allow volume() to be called using an incorrect type and/or number of arguments.
                        Eg: following will not generate a compiler error message even though it is wrong.
                                volume(120.2, 99.3);		 // missing last argument */
#include <stdio.h>
double volume(); 	/* old-style FORWARD DECLARATION for volume() */

int main(void){	
    double vol;

    vol = volume(12.2, 5.67, 9.03); 
    printf("Volume: %f", vol);

    return 0;
}

/* volume(): Compute the volume of a cube. */
double volume(double s1, double s2, double s3) {
    return s1*s2*s3;
}




/* Example 2: How to prototype a function that takes no arguments? For example, this function simply outputs a line of periods:

                void line(){	
                    int i; 
                    
                    for(i=0; i<80; i++) printf(".");
                }

                If you try to use the void line() as a prototype, 
                    it won't work because the compiler will think that as a old-style declaration method. 
                The solution to this problem is through the use of the "void" keyword, when a function has no parameters.
                        void line(void);
                This explicitly tells the compiler that the function has no parameters, and any call to that function that has parameters is an error.  */

// You must make sure to also use "void" in definition of function.
void line(void){	
    int i; 
    
    for(i=0; i<80; i++) printf(".");
}














Notes
[1]	As you know, the standard library function sqrt( ) returns a  double value. You might be wondering how the compiler knows this. The answer is that sqrt( ) is prototyped in its header file MATH.H. To see the importance of using the header file, try to program consisting sqrt() without its header file. 

[2]	In general, each of C's standard library functions has its prototype specified in a header file. For example, printf() and scanf() have their prototypes in STDIO.H. This is one of the reasons that it is important to include the appropriate header file for each library function you use.

[3]	Some 'character-based'-functions have a return type of int rather than char. For example, the getchar( ) function's return type is int, not char. The reason for this is found in the fact that C very cleanly handles the conversion of characters to integers and integers back to characters. There is no loss of information. For example, the following program is perfectly valid:
#include <stdio.h>
int char_as_int(void);	/*int type return value instead of char type*/
int main (void){ 	char ch;
ch = char_as_int();	printf("%c", ch);
return 0;	}
int char_as_int(void){	return 'a';	}

When char_as_int() returns, it elevates the character 'a' to an integer by adding a high-order byte (or bytes) containing zeros. When this value is assigned to ch in main( ), the high-order byte (or bytes) is removed. One reason to declare functions like char_as_int() as returning an integer instead of a character is to allow various error values to be returned that are intentionally outside the range of a char.

[4]	When a function returns a pointer, both the function and its prototype must declare the same pointer return type. 
#include <stdio.h>
int *in_it(int x); 	/*prototype of pointer returning function */
int count; 		/*count as global variable*/

int main(void){ 	int *p; /*global variable count is int type so p is int type pointer*/
p = in_it(110); 	/* return pointer equal : p=&count*/ 
printf("count (through p) is %d", *p);
return 0;}

int * in_it(int x){	count = x;
return &count; 	/* return a pointer */	}

Prints = count (through p) is 110
the function in_it( ) returns a pointer to the global variable count. Notice the way that the return type for in_it( ) is specified. This same general form is used for any sort of pointer return type. 

[5]	If a function returns a pointer, then it must make sure that the object being pointed to does not go out-of-scope when the function returns. This means that you must not return pointers to local variables.

[6]	The main( ) function does not have (nor does it require) a prototype. This allows you to define main( ) any way that is supported by your compiler. Here we use int main(void) { ... } because it is one of the most common forms. Another frequently used form of main( ) is 
void main(void) { ... }
This form is used when no value is returned by main( ). 

ï‚¤	The reason main( ) does not have a prototype is to allow C to be used in the widest variety of environments. Since the precise conditions present at program start-up and what actions must occur at program termination may differ widely from one operating system to the next, C allows the acceptable forms of main( ) to be determined by the compiler. However, nearly all compilers will accept int main(void) and void main(void) .
