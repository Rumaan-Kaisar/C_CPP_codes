/* 
	---------------    scanf() Details    ---------------

	The prototype for scanf() is:

		int scanf(char *control-string, ... );
		
		Eg:
		scanf("%d.%d", &i, &j);
		Here "%d.%d" is the "CONTROL STRING" and '&i, &j'  are the varargs


	The "CONTROL-STRING" consists mostly of FORMAT SPECIFIERS. However, it can contain other characters. 
		The format specifiers determine how scanf() reads information into the 'variables pointed to by the arguments' that follow the 'control string'. 
			The specifiers are matched in order, from left to right, with the arguments. 
			There must be as many arguments as there are specifiers. 

		scanf() returns the number of fields assigned values. 
			If an error occurs before any assignments are made, "EOF" is returned.


	You can specify a "MAXIMUM FIELD WIDTH" for all specifiers except %c (one character field)  and %n (to which the concept does not apply). 
		The MAXIMUM FIELD WIDTH is specified as an "unsigned" integer, and it immediately precedes the 'format specifier character'.
		For example, this limits the maximum length of a 'STRING' assigned to str to 3 characters:  
				scanf("%3s", str);


	Limitation of scanf() to read 'strings': 
		You can use scanf() to read a string using the %s specifier, but when scanf() inputs a string, 
		It stops reading that string when the first whitespace character is encountered (i.e. scanf() can read a word, not whole sentence). 
		A whitespace character is either a 'space', a 'tab', or a 'newline'

		This is why gets() is generally used to input strings.

	If a space appears in the control string, then scanf() will begin reading and 
		discarding whitespace characters until the first non-whitespace character is encountered
			following used to read operators for arithmetic operations:
			printf("Enter operation: "); 
					scanf("%d %c %d", &i, &op, &j);


	If any other character appears in the control string, scanf() reads and discards 
		all matching characters until it reads the first character that does not match that character .
	

	Line-Buffering: 
		As scanf() is generally implemented, it line-buffers input in the same way that getehar() often does. 


	Code	Meaning						Details
	%c	Read a single character	
	%d	Read a decimal integer	
	%i	Read a decimal integer	
	%e	Read a floating-point number	
	%f	Read a floating-point number	
	%g	Read a floating-point number	
	%o	Read an octal number			used to read an unsigned integer using octal  bases
	%s	Read a string	
	%x	Read a hexadecimal number		used to read an unsigned integer using hexadecimal  bases
	%p	Read a pointer	inputs a memory address using the format determined by the host environment
	%n	Receives an integer value equal to the number of characters read so far	
		assigns the number of characters input up to the point the %n is encountered to 
		the integer variable pointed to by its matching argument,  l or h applied for long or short .

	%u	Read an unsigned integer	
	%[]	Scan for a set of characters	


	The specifiers %d, %i, %u, %x, and %o (integer type specifiers) may be modified by 
		the 'h' when inputting into a short variable and by 'l' when inputting into a long variable.

	The specifiers %e, %f, and %g are equivalent. They all read floating-point numbers 
		represented in either scientific notation or standard decimal notation .  
		To read a double, modify them with 'l'. To read a long double, modify them with 'L'.




	Use of   %* (no associated argument): 
		you can suppress(neglect) the assignment of a field by putting an asterisk "*" immediately after the % sign. 
			This can be very useful when inputting information that contains needless characters. 
			(eg : input password containing "-" : abc-3nh-th7). 
			
			For example, following scanf() used to assign 555 to first, discard the -, and assign 2345 to second. 
			Since the hyphen is not needed, there is no reason to assign it to anything. Hence, NO ASSOCIATED ARGUMENT is supplied.

				int first , second;
				scanf( "%d%*c%d", &first. &second);

			inputting : 555-2345, then scanf() will read as first=555 and second=2345, the "-" will be skipped.
			%*c to skip single character




	scanset  %[] : 
		A "SCANSET SPECIFIER" is created by putting a 'list of characters' inside square brackets, 
			for example, here is a 'scanset specifier' containing the letters 'ABC' :   %[ABC]	 //reads A,B,C from input

		When scanf() encounters a scanset, it begins reading input into the "character array" pointed to by the scanset's matching argument.  
			It will only continue reading characters as long as the 'next character is part of the scanset'. 

		As soon as a character that is not part of the scanset is found, scanf() stops reading input for this specifier and 
			moves on to any others in the control string.

		You can specify a range in a scanset using the - (hyphen), for example, this scanset specifies the characters 'A' through 'Z',
					%[A-Z]

			Technically, the use of the hyphen to specify a range is not specified by the ANSI C standard, but it is nearly universally accepted.

		Exclusion: When the scanset is very large, sometimes it is easier to specify what is "not part of a scanset", 
			To do this, precede the set with a ^ , for example, 	
			
			%[^0123456789] 		// When scanf() encounters this scanset, it will read any characters 'except' the digits 0 through 9.

/* Example 1: To see the effect of the %s specifier, try this program.

/* Example 2: Hereâ€™s an example of a "scanset" that accepts both the Uppercase and Lowercase characters (but no spaces). 
				Try entering fiew words. After you press ENTER, only the letters that you entered before 
				pressing the non-letter key (spaces and othr char) will be contained in str. */
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
	char str[80];

				Notice that the format for entering the information scanf("%d %c %d", &i, &op, &j);

/* Example 5: following illustrates the maximum-field-width specifier:

/* Example 12: What is a scanset? */
A scanset is a set of characters that scanf() matches with input. As long as the characters being read are part of the scanset, 
scanf() continues to input them into the array pointed to by the scansets corresponding argument.


	

/* Example 13: Write a program, using scanf(), that inputs your first name, birth date (using the format mm/dd/yy), 
                and telephone number. Redisplay the information on the screen to verify that it was input correctly. */
