When C++ was first invented, the keyword overload was required to create an overloaded
function. Although overload is now obsolete and no longer supported by modern C++ compilers, you may still see overload used in old programs, so it is a good idea to understand how
it was applied.
The general form of overload is shown here,
overload func_name ;
where func-name is the name of the function to be overloaded. This statement must precede
the overloaded function declarations. For example, this tells the compiler that you will be
overloading a function called time():
overload timer ;
Remember: overload is obsolete and no longer supported by modern C++ compilers.
