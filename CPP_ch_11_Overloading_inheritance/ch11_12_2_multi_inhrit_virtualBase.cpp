    Problems with "one derived" & "multiple direct base":
        A potential problem exists when multiple classes are directly inherited by a derived class. 

        When a class is inherited multiple times indirectly through different paths in a class hierarchy, 
            it can cause a problem called the "diamond problem" ‚Äî 
            where a base class ends up with multiple copies in the final derived class.
        
        Consider the following class hierarchy:

                           Base
                          /   \
                         /     \
                        /       \
                    Derived1   Derived2
                        \       /
                         \     /
                          \   /
                        Derived3

            Here the base class "Base" is inherited by both "Derived1" and "Derived2". 
            "Derived3" directly inherits both "Derived1" and "Derived2". 

        Now, "Derived3" has two copies of Base ‚Äî one through "Derived1" and one through "Derived2".
        This creates a conflict (ambiguity) if "Derived3" tries to access a member of "Base" ‚Äî 
            because it won't be clear which "Base" to use.



    Virtual Base Class
        To avoid this problem, inherit "Base" as a "virtual base class" in both "Derived1" and "Derived2".
        This ensures only one shared copy of Base exists in "Derived3", no matter how many paths inherit it.
        The "virtual" keyword precedes the base class "access specifier" when it is inherited by a derived class.

Virtual Base Classes



-----------------------------------

üìå Example Scenario:





üìñ How to declare:
cpp
Copy
Edit
class Derived1 : virtual public Base { };
class Derived2 : virtual public Base { };
The keyword virtual before the access specifier (public) handles this.

üìå Summary:
Problem	Solution
Multiple indirect copies of a base class	Use virtual base classes to share one copy
Ambiguity accessing base members	Virtual inheritance prevents this issue

Virtual base classes






ÔÅÖ	The only difference between a normal base and a virtual base occurs when an object inherits the base more than once. 





ÔÅ≤	Example 1:  Here virtual base class prevents two copies of base from being present in derived3.
class base {
   public :
       int i;
};	// Base as virtual.
class derived1 : virtual public base {
		public :  int j;	   };	// base as virtual here , too.
class derived2 : virtual public base {
		public : int k; 
		};
// only one copy of base is present 
class derived3 : public derived1, public derived2
{
public :
	int product() { return i*j*k; }
};	int main() { derived3 ob;
	ob.i=10; // unambiguous : only one copy present
	ob.j=3;
	ob.k=5;
	cout<< "Product is"<< ob.product() <<'\n';
return 0; }



ÔÅÜ	If derived1 and derived2 had not inherited base as virtual, the statement ob.i = 10; would have been ambiguous and a compile-time error would have resulted.
ÔÅ≤	It is important to understand that when a base is inherited as virtual by a derived, that base still exists within that derived. For example, this fragment is perfectly valid:
derived1 ob_drv1;  	// we've used derived3 type object in the above
ob_drv1.i = 100;


ÔÅÖ	The only difference between a normal base and a virtual base occurs when an object inherits the base more than once.
