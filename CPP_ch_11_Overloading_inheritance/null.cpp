/* Example 5: Given the following class definition, is it possible to dynamically allocate an array of these
objects?
class test
{
char *p;
int *q;
int count ;
public :
test ( char *x, int *y, int c)
{
p = x;
q = y;
count = c;
}
// ...
};

5. It is appropriate to use default arguments when there are one or more values that will
occur frequently. Is is inappropriate when there is no value or values that have a greater
likelihood of occurring.



/* Example 6: What is a copy constructor and under what circumstances is it called? */
6. No, because there is no way to initialize a dynamic array. This class has only one constructor, and it requires initializers.
7. A copy constructor is a special constructor that is called when one object initializes another. This circumstance can occur in any of the following three ways: When one object
is explicitly used to initialize another, when an object is passed to a function, or when a
temporary object is created as a function return value.
