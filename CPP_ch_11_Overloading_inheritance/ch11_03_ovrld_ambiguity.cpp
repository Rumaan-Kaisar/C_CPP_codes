    Ambiguity Caused By Overloading:
        Overloading-caused ambiguity can be introduced through 
            - type conversions, 
            - reference parameters, and 
            - default arguments. 

        Further, some types of ambiguity are caused by the "overloaded functions" themselves. 
        Other types occur in the manner in which an overloaded function is called. 


    solutions:
        Most often we'll "Explicitly Cast the Argument" to avoid ambiguty.
        Another solution is making the "Function Signatures" more distinct

/*  ------------    Type Conversion Ambiguity    ------------

    Type Conversion Ambiguity: 
        When an argument has a "compatible (but not exact) type" with the function parameter, C++ automatically converts it to the target type. 
            A "compatible (but not exact) type" refers to a type that can be implicitly converted 
                to another type through C++'s automatic type conversion rules, 
            For example, C++ will automatically convert types like "char to int" or "float to double" 
                when passing them as arguments if needed.

        This automatic type conversion may create ambiguity 
            if there are multiple overloaded functions that can match due to the conversion.

        Example: 
            This type conversion allows a function like putchar() to accept a "char" argument, even though its parameter is specified as "int".
*/




/* Example 1: Consider the following example with "int" and "double" types, also notice:
                    printValue(int) takes an int parameter, and also accept a "char" argument
                    printValue(double) takes a double parameter, and also accept a "float" argument


                ambiguity:
                    When printValue(value) is called with value of type "float", it causes ambiguity because:

                        float can be "implicitly" converted to int for printValue(int).
                        float can also be "implicitly" converted to double for printValue(double).

                Since both conversions are compatible (but not exact matches), the "compiler can't decide" which overload to choose, 
                    resulting in an ambiguous call.


                Solution:
                    Use an "explicit cast" to match the type "exactly", like 
                        printValue(static_cast<int>(value)); 
                                or 
                        printValue(static_cast<double>(value));.

                    Modify the function to take a float if float arguments are common in usage.

    This type of ambiguity arises when the "argument type" is compatible with "multiple overloaded functions" but doesnâ€™t match any of them exactly.

#include <iostream>

void printValue(int x) {
    std::cout << "Integer: " << x << std::endl;
}

void printValue(double x) {
    std::cout << "Double: " << x << std::endl;
}


int main() {
    float value = 5.5f;

    printValue(value); // Ambiguous call

    return 0;
}




/* Example 2: Notice the following program:
                    The compiler correctly selects the appropriate version of f() when called with either a "float" or "double".

                    However, when called with an "int", ambiguity arises. 
                        The compiler can't decide whether to promote the "int" to a "float" or "double", 
                        Does the compiler call f(float) or f(double)?
                            as both conversions are valid. This creates an ambiguous situation.


                f(x) calls f(float) because x is of type float.
                f(y) calls f(double) because y is of type double.
                f(10) would be ambiguous because 10 can be implicitly converted to either float or double.

                To resolve this, use an "explicit cast" to specify which function to call:
                    f(static_cast<float>(10)) calls f(float)
                    f(static_cast<double>(10)) calls f(double)

    float x = 10.09;
    double y = 10.09;

    std::cout << f(x) << std::endl;   // unambiguous - calls f(float)
    std::cout << f(y) << std::endl;   // unambiguous - calls f(double)

    // followig line cause "Ambiguous ERR"
    std::cout << f(10) << std::endl;     // ambiguous - should 10 be converted to float or double?

    // To resolve ambiguity, use an explicit cast:
    std::cout << f(static_cast<float>(10)) << std::endl;   // calls f(float)
    std::cout << f(static_cast<double>(10)) << std::endl;  // calls f(double)

/* Example 3: when this function is called with the wrong type of argument, 
                C++'s automatic conversion rules cause an ambiguous situation.

                When f() is called with the numeric constant 86, 
                    the compiler cannot know whether to call f(unsigned char) or f(char). 
                    Either conversion is equally valid, thus leading to ambiguity.

/* ------------    Ambiguity by Reference    ------------
    Ambiguity by Reference:
        In C++ there is no syntactical difference between 
            -   calling a function that takes a "value parameter" and 
            -   calling a function that takes a "reference parameter"
    
        This can lead to ambiguity, especially if two overloaded functions exist, 
            one taking a value and the other a reference :
*/
#include <iostream>

int f(int a, int b){ 
    std::cout << "value" << std::endl;
    return a+b; }      // function with both parameters by value

int f(int a, int &b){ 
    std::cout << "reference" << std::endl;
    return a-b; }     // function with second parameter by reference


int main(){
    int x=1, y=2;

    std::cout << f(x, y);    // ambiguous: which version of f() is called?

    return 0;
}

// Here, f(x, y) is ambiguous because it could be calling either version of the function

// Solutions:
// Make the Function Signatures More Distinct
int f(int a, int b) { return a + b; }            // Pass-by-value version
int f(int a, const int &b) { return a - b; }     // Pass-by-reference version with const

// Explicitly Cast the Argument
std::cout << f(x, static_cast<int>(y));  // Calls `f(int, int)`
std::cout << f(x, y);  // This will call `f(int, int&)` because `y` is passed as a reference





/* ------------    Ambiguity by default arguments    ------------
    Another type of ambiguity is caused when you are overloading a function in which one or more overloaded functions use a default argument. Consider following program:
 */
int f(int a) { return a*a; }
int f(int a, int b = 0) { return a*b; }	int main() { cout << f(10 , 2); /* calls f(int , int) */ 
cout << f (10) ;    /* ambiguous: f(int ) or f(int , int )? */ 
return 0; }
Here the call f(10, 2) is perfectly acceptable, and unambiguous. However, the compiler has now way of knowing whether the call f(10) is calling the first version of f() or the second version with b defaulting.
