    Default Arguments in Functions:
        Default arguments allow you to assign a default value to a function parameter, 
            so if a function is called "without specifying arguments" for those parameters, the default values are used. 

        Using default arguments is essentially a "shorthand form" of function overloading.


    Assign a default argument:
        To assign a default argument, follow the parameter with an equal sign (=) and specify the default value. 
        For example, the function below provides default values of 0 for both of its parameters:

                void f(int a = 0, int b = 0);

        If the function f() is called without arguments, it will use the default values a = 0 and b = 0.


    Similar to variable initialization:
        Notice that this syntax is similar to variable initialization. 
        This function can now be called three different ways. 

            it can be called with both arguments specified. Example: 
                    f(10, 99);      // a is 10, b is 99 

            it can be called with only the first argument specified. In this case, b will default to 0. Example: 
                    f(10);          // a is 10, b defaults to 0 

            Finally, f() can be called with no arguments, causing both a and b to default to 0. Example: 
                    f();            // a and b default to 0



    Note:
        There is no way to default 'a' and specify 'b'.

        Default arguments must be "CONSTANTS" or "GLOBAL" variables. They cannot be "local" variables or other parameters.

        Default arguments must be specified only once, either in the:
            function's prototype or 
            function's in its definition (must precedes the function's first use)
            
        The defaults CANNOT be specified in both the "prototype" and the "definition"


        All default parameters must be to the right side of any parameters that don't have defaults

                    void example(int a, int b = 10)     // Correct
                    void example(int a = 5, int b)      // Incorrect


        Also specified parameters can't stay left side of the default parameters
            i.e. Once you begin to define default parameters, you cannot specify any parameters that have no defaults


        Once the "first default argument" is specified, all following arguments must also have default values. 
            You can't skip some arguments. 
            For example, following will cause a compile-time error because "b" doesn't have a default:

                    void f(int a=0, int b)  // wrong! b must have a default too


        You can "omit" only the arguments from the "rightmost side". 
        You cannot skip middle arguments without skipping the ones after them.
            
            For example, in the function:
                            void f(int a = 0, int b = 1, int c = 2);

            You can call:
                            f();          // uses a=0, b=1, c=2
                            f(10);        // uses a=10, b=1, c=2
                            f(10, 20);    // uses a=10, b=20, c=2
                            f(10, 20, 30); // uses a=10, b=20, c=30


        Default arguments should "typically be placed" in the function declaration (prototype) and 
            not in the function definition itself.
            For example: 

                void f(int a = 0, int b = 0);  // Default values in the declaration

                void f(int a, int b) {
                    // function body
                }


        If "no single value" is more likely to be used, providing a default value isn't useful.
        If a specific value is required most of the time (say nine times out of ten), 
            it's a good idea to set it as a default argument for the function.



    DEFAULT arguments instead of OVERLOADING:
        A constructor is often overloaded to allow the creation of both initialized and uninitialized objects. 
        However, you can avoid overloading a constructor by giving it one or more default arguments. For example,

            // using default argument
            class myclass {
                    int x;
                public:
                    myclass(int n = 0) { x = n; }   // Constructor with a default argument
                    void display() {std::cout << "x = " << x << endl;}
            };


            // using constructor-overloading
            class myclass {
                    int x;
                public:
                    // Overloaded constructors
                    myclass(int n) { x = n; }
                    myclass() { x = 0; }
                    void display() {std::cout << "x = " << x << endl;}
            };


        So it is possible to create objects that have "explicit initial values" and those for which the default value is sufficient.



    ------------    Mixing DEFAULT arguments with Function OVERLOADING    ------------
    You can "mix" DEFAULT arguments and function OVERLOADING. 
    Be CAREFUL because they might CONFLICT if multiple overloaded functions match a call due to default arguments.



    ------------    Defaults Across Multiple Files    ------------
    If you declare a function with DEFAULT ARGUMENTS in a "header file" and define it in a "source file", 
        place the DEFAULT VALUES only in the "header file" to avoid redefinition errors



    ------------    Copy-Constructor with DEFAULT arguments    ------------
    We've seen the general form of a copy constructor with only one parameter. 
    However, it is possible to create copy constructors that take additional arguments, 
        as long as the additional arguments have default values. For example, 

            myclass( const myclass &obj , int x = 0){ 
                // body of constructor
            }

    As long as the first argument is a "reference to the object being copied", and all other arguments "default", 
        the function qualifies as a "copy constructor".

/* Example 1: Here is a program that illustrates the default argumnets 

                Remember that once the first default argument is specified, all following parameters must have defaults as well.
                For example, this slightly different version of f() causes a compiletime error:

                    // wrong ! b must have default , too
                    void f(int a=0, int b){
                        std::cout <<"a: "<< a <<", b: "<< b;

/* Example 2: To understand how "default arguments" are related to function OVERLOADING, 
                consider the following program that overloads the function rect_area().
                This function calculates the area of a rectangle.


                The function is OVERLOADED in two ways:
                    non-square: with both "length" and "width" of the rectangle are passed, the first version is used.
                    square: When only one argument (length) is passed, the second version is called.

                However we can use "default arguments" instead:
                    Instead of creating two separate functions, the second parameter can be given a default value
                    If the default value is passed, the function assumes itâ€™s a square and uses the same value for both dimensions.

/*  Version 2: using default argument

    The default value for "width" is set to 0 because no rectangle can have a width of 0.
    If rect_area() sees the default value (0), it automatically assumes the shape is a square and 
        uses the "length" value for both length and width.

    Default arguments can simplify code and reduce the need for function overloading.
    However, there are still cases where function overloading is necessary.

/* Example 4: A default argument can be useful for selecting an OPTION in a function.
                A parameter can be given a "default value" to act as a flag to indicate using the previously selected option.

                For example the function print() displays text.
                    If "how" is set to "ignore", the text is displayed as is.
                    If "how" is "upper", it is displayed in uppercase.
                    If "how" is "lower", it is shown in lowercase.

                    char *s: The string to be printed.
                    int how = -1: The how parameter is used to control how the string is displayed

// --------  rev[24-Oct-2024]  --------

/*  Explanation:

// ----  prompt 1  ----
In C++, remembering a previous state or value (like the "old case" for how in the print() function example) can be done by using static variables. These variables retain their value between function calls.

Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation:

A static variable inside a function maintains its value even after the function returns.
So, if you want to remember the "old case" in the print() function, you can declare how as static, and it will preserve its value across multiple calls.


// ----  prompt 2  ----
The program you've written successfully demonstrates how to use default arguments and a static variable to "remember" the last how parameter in the print() function. Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown:

Key Elements:
Static Variable oldcase:
The static variable oldcase is used to remember the last case (ignore, upper, lower) across multiple function calls. This way, if how is not specified, it reuses the previous setting.

Function Parameters with Default Value:
The how parameter is given a default value of -1. If the user doesn't specify how, it uses the last case (`old


// ----  prompt 3  ----
In the provided program, the variable oldcase is declared as static inside the print() function. Since static local variables retain their value across multiple function calls, this allows the function to "remember" the previous how value even after the function returns.

Hereâ€™s how the old case is remembered:

The first time print() is called, oldcase is initialized to ignore.
If the argument how is not provided or is negative, the function uses the value stored in oldcase from the last call.
After processing the string, oldcase is updated with the current value of how, so that it can be reused in the next call.
Thus, by retaining the oldcase value across function calls, the function can "remember" the last used case setting.



Is a static variable destroyed after a function call, even if it's defined inside the function?

No, static variables are not destroyed after a function call, even if they are defined inside the function.

Key characteristics of static variables:
Lifetime:
Static variables have a lifetime that lasts for the entire duration of the program. Once initialized, they retain their value between multiple calls to the function, unlike regular local variables, which are destroyed at the end of each function call.

Scope:
The scope of a static variable defined inside a function is local to the functionâ€”it can only be accessed within that function. However, its value is remembered between invocations.

Example:
In your program, the variable oldcase inside the print() function is declared as static:

cpp
Copy code
void print(char *s, int how){   
    static int oldcase = ignore;  // Static variable

    // Logic to print based on case
}
This means that oldcase will be initialized only once (the first time the function is called), and its value will persist across future calls to print(). It is not destroyed after the function returns.
When the function is called again, oldcase will still hold the value it had from the previous function call. This allows the program to "remember" the last case setting.
Conclusion:
The static variable inside the function remains in memory and retains its value until the program terminates. It is not destroyed after each function call.



* Static local variables are not destroyed when the function ends.
* They stay in memory for the entire duration of the program.
* Even though they are defined inside a function, they retain their value between function calls.
* Their scope is limited to the function, but their lifetime lasts as long as the program runs.

/* Example 5: Earlier in this chapter, you saw the general form of a copy constructor. This general form
was shown with only one parameter. However, it is possible to create copy constructors
that take additional arguments, as long as the additional arguments have default values.
For example, the following is also an acceptable form of a copy constructor: */



myclass ( const myclass &obj , int x = 0)
{
// body of constructor
}
As long as the first argument is a reference to the object being copied, and all other
arguments default, the function qualifies as a copy constructor. This flexibility allows you
to create copy constructors that have other uses.




/* Example 6: Although default arguments are powerful and convenient, when used correctly, default
arguments allow a function to perform its job in an efficient and easy-to-use manner.
However, this is only the case when the default value given to a parameter makes sense.
For example, if the argument is the value wanted nine times out of ten, giving a function
a default argument to this effect is obviously a good idea. However, in cases in which no
one value is more likely to be used than another, or when there is no benefit to using a
default argument as a flag value, it makes little sense to provide a default value. Actually,
providing a default argument when one is not called for destructures your program and
tends to mislead anyone else who has to use that function.
As with function overloading, part of becoming an excellent C++ programmer is knowing
when to use a default argument and when not to.

character in the string immediately following the end of the number. The long integer
equivalent of the numeric string is returned. base must be in the range 2 to 38. However,
most commonly, base 10 is used.
Create a function called mystrtoi() that works the same as strtoi() except that ( base)
