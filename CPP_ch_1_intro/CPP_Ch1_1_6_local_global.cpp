Global: Variables declared outside all functions.
    #   used by any function in
    #   exist the entire time your program is executing


Local variables: Variables declared inside a function are called local variables.
    #   accessed by-only the function in which it is declared. 
    #   common to declare all local variables beginning of the function

    #   local variables in one function have no relationship to the local vanables in another function.
    #   the two variables are completely separate from and unrelated to each other even if they have same name.


SCOPE: local variables are created when a function is called, and they are destroyed when the function is exited.
