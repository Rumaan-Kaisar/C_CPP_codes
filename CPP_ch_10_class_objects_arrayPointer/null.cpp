Before proceeding, you should be able to correctly answer the following questions and do the
exercises.




/* Example 1: Given the following class, what are the names of its 'constructor' and 'destructor' functions? */

class widgit{
        int x, y;
    public:
        // ... fill in constructor and destructor functions
};

// Constructor is called widgit() and 
// Destructor is called ~widgit().






/* Example 2: When is a constructor function called? When is a destructor function called? 

                Constructor function is called when an object is created 
                    (i.e., when an object comes into existence). 

                Destructor is called when an object is destroyed.
*/






/* Example 3: Given the following base class, 
                show how it can be inherited by a derived class called 'Mars'. 
*/

class planet{
        int moons;
        double dis_from_sun;
        double diameter;
        double mass;
    public:
        // ...
};

// Ans:  derived class called 'Mars'
class Mars:public planet{
    // ...
};




/* Example 4: There are two ways to cause a function to be expanded 'in-line'. What are they? 
                1. use 'inline' keyword: 
                    You can expand a function in line either by preceding its definition with the 'inline' specifier

                2. define a function inside a class declaration:
                    Include the functions definition within a class declaration.
*/




/* Example 5: Give two possible restrictions to 'in-line' functions. 

                An in-line function must be defined before it is first used. 
                Other common restrictions:
                    no 'loops'
                    must not be 'recursive'
                    no 'goto' or a 'switch'
                    no 'static' variables
*/






/* Example 6: Given the following class, show how an object called 'ob' that passes the value 
                '100 to a'and 'X to c' would be declared. 
*/
class sample {
        int a;
        char c;
    public:
        sample(int x, char ch) { a = x; c = ch; }
    // ...

sample ob (100 , 'X');

Before proceeding, you should be able to answer the following questions and perform the exercises.
1. What single prerequisite must be met in order for one object to be assigned to another?
2. Given this class fragment,
class samp
{
double *p;
public :
samp ( double d)
{
p = ( double *) malloc ( sizeof ( double ));
if (!p)
exit (1) ; // allocation error
*p = d;
} ~
samp () { free (p); }
// ..
};
// ...
samp ob1 (123.09) , ob2 (0.0) ;
// ...
ob2 = ob1 ;
84A CLOSER LOOK AT CLASSES
SKILLS CHECK
what problem is caused by the assignment of ob1 to ob2?
3. Given this class,
class planet
{
int moons ;
double dist_from_sun ; // in miles
double diameter ;
double mass ;
public :
// ....
double get_miles () { return dist_from_sun ; }
};
create a function called light() that takes as an argument an object of type planet
and returns the number of seconds that it takes light from the sun to reach the planet.
(Assume that light travels at 186,000 miles per second and that dist from sun is specified
in miles.)
4. Can the address of an object be passed to a function as an argument?
5. Using the stack class, write a function called loadstack() that returns a stack that is
already loaded with the letters of the alphabet(a-z). Assign this stack to another object
in the calling routine and prove that it contains the alphabet. Be sure to change the stack
size so it is large enough to hold the alphabet.
6. Explain why you must be careful when passing objects to a function or returning objects
from a function.
7. What is a friend function





// -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-    Cumulative Skills Check    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This section checks how well you have integrated material in this chapter with that from the
preceding chapters.
1. Functions can be overloaded as long as the number or type of their parameters differs.
Overload loadstack() from Exercise 5 of the Mastery Skills Check so that it takes an
integer, called upper, as a parameter. In the overloaded version, if upper is 1, load the
stack with the uppercase alphabet. Otherwise, load it with the lowercase alphabet.
2. Using the strtype class shown in Section 3.1, Example 3, add a friend function that
takes as an argument a pointer to an object of type strtype and returns a pointer to the
string pointed to by that object. (That is, have the function return p.) Call this function
get string().
3. Experiment: When an object of a derived class is assigned to another object of the same
derived class, is the data associated with the base class also copied? To find out, use the
following two classes and write a program that demonstrates what happens.
class base
{
int a;
public :
void load_a ( int n) { a = n; }
85TEACH YOURSELF
C++
int get_a () { return a; }
};
class derived : public base
{
int b;
public :
void load_b ( int n) { b = n; }
int get_b () { return b; }
};

Before proceeding, you should be able to correctly answer the following questions and do the
exercises.
1. When one object is assigned to another, what precisely takes place?
2. Can any troubles or side effects occur when one object is assigned to another? (Give an
example.)
3. When an object is passed as an argument to a function, a copy of that object is made. Is
the copyâ€™s constructor function called? Is its destructor called?
4. By default, objects are passed to functions by value, which means that what occurs to
the copy inside the function is not supposed to affect the argument used in the call. Can
there be a violation of this principle? If so, give an example.
5. Given the following class, create a function called make sum() their returns an object of
type summation. Have this function prompt the user for a number and then construct
an object having this value and return it to the calling procedure. Demonstrate that the
function works.
class summation
{
int num ;
long sum ; // summation of num
public :
void set_sum ( int n);
void show_sum ()
{
cout << num << " summed is " << sum << "\n";
}
};
void summation :: set_sum (int n)
{
int i;
num = n;
sum = 0;
for (i =1; i <=n; i ++)
sum += i;
}
6. In the preceding question, the function set sum() was not defined in line within the summation class declaration. Give a reason why this might be necessary for some compilers.
7. Given the following class, show how to add a friend function called isneg() that takes one
parameter of type myclass and returns true if num is negative and false otherwise.

8. Can a friend function be friends with more than one class?
