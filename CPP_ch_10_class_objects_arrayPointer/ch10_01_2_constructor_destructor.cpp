/* ------------    INITIALIZATION using "constructor"    ------------

    Object INITIALIZATION using "constructor": 
        When applied to real problems, virtually every object you create will require some sort of initialization. 
            To address this situation, C++ allows a constructor function to be included in a class declaration. 
            
        A classâ€™s constructor is 'called each time an object of that class is created'. 
            Any initialization that needs to be 'performed on an object' can be done automatically by the constructor function.

        A constructor function has the 'same name as the class' of which it is a part 
            it has 'no return type'. It is 'illegal' for a constructor to have a 'return type'.

    
    The constructor is called when the object is created. 
        An object is 'created' when that object's declaration statement is EXECUTED. 


    For "GLOBAL objects", an object's constructor is 'called ONCE', when the program first begins execution. 
    For "LOCAL objects", the constructor is 'called EACH TIME' the declaration statement is executed.

/*  ------------    Destroy objects using "destructor"    ------------
    
    Destroy objects using "destructor":  
        The 'complement of a constructor' is the DESTRUCTOR. 
        This function is called when an object is destroyed. 
        
        For example, an object that allocates memory when it is created will 'want to free that memory' when it is destroyed. 
        
        The 'name' of destructor-function is the "name of its class", preceded by a "tilde" "~" . 

    It is not possible to take the ADDRESS of either a 'constructor' or a 'destructor'.

    A class's DESTRUCTOR is called when 'an object is destroyed'. 
        'Local' objects are destroyed when they go out of scope. 
        'Global' objects are destroyed when the program ends. Example:

                    exiting the main() function destroys object and prints 'Destructing. . ..'

                also notice when extra_fn() called, new object 'ob2' is initialized and prints 'In constructor'
                    "Inside extra_fn" is printed by extra_fn() 
                    after exitig extra_fn() the 'scope' is lost and 'ob2' is destroyes and prints 'Destructing. . ..'

// 'std::endl' and '\n' both seem to do the same thing but there is a subtle difference between them. 
    // "std::cout << std::endl" inserts a 'new line and flushes the stream(output buffer)', 
    // whereas std::cout <<"\n "just inserts a new line.

// Therefore, "std::cout << std::endl;" can be said equivalent to- std::cout << "\n" << flush; 




/* 
    ------------    'variable declaration' VS 'object declaration'    ------------
    In C++, a variable declaration statement is an "action statement".
    
    In 'C', it is easy to think of 'declaration statements' as simply 'establishing' variables. 
        
    However, in C++, because an 'object' might have a CONSTRUCTOR, 
        a "variable (i.e. object ) declaration" statement may, in fact, cause a considerable 'number of actions' to occur.




    Other usage Restriction: 
        Don't use a constructor or destructor to perform actions "not directly related to the INITIALIZATION or orderly DESTRUCTION of an object" 
        
        Technically, a constructor or a destructor can perform any type of operation. 
            The code within these functions does not have to 'initialize' or 'reset anything' related to the class for which they are defined. 
            For example, a constructor for the preceding examples could have computed 'pi' to 100 places.
