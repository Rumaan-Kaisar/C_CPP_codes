    PASSING objects to functions:
        Objects can be passed to functions as arguments similar to other data-types
        Declare the function's PARAMETER as a "class type" and 
            then use an 'object' of that class as an 'argument' when calling the function. 

                type function_name( class_type obj_1, class_type obj_2, . . . . );


        As with other types of data, by default all objects are "passed by value" to a function.
    


    What is "passing by value"?
        The default method of parameter passing in C++, including objects, is 'by value'. 
        This means that a "BITWISE COPY" of the argument is made and it is this copy that is used by the function. 
        Therefore, changes to the object inside the function "DO NOT AFFECT" the calling (original) object.  
        
    Objects , like other parameters , are passed by value . 
        Thus changes to the parameter inside a function have "NO EFFECT" on the object used in the call.



    ------------    How to modify / change the passed object using a function    ------------
    passing the ADRESS of an object:
        The address of an object can be passed to a function so that 
            the argument used in the call can be modified by the function
        i.e. changes to the object inside the function will affect the calling (original) object.

/*  ------------    CONSTRUCTOR & DESTRUCTOR for object passed as function parameters    ------------

    Above two example reflects the same thing that we've discussed in 
        C's passing argument's address in function parameters ( recall  C_Ch5_3_1_func_param.c ).



    CONSTRUCTOR function is NOT called:
        When a "copy of an object" is created because it is used as an argument to a function, 
            the constructor function is not called. 

        Because the constructor is generally used to initialize the object, 
        It must not be called when making a "copy of an already existing object" passed to a function. 
        Doing so would "alter the contents" of the object. 

        When passing an object to a function, 
            you want the current state of the object, not its initial state.



    DESTRUCTOR function is CALLED:
        However, when the copy is destroyed (by going out of scope when the function returns), 
        Destructor is called because the object might perform some 
            operation that must be undone when it goes out of scope.

        One important point :  
            when an object is passed to a function, a "copy of that object" is made. 
            Further, when that function returns, the "copy's destructor function" is called. 
*/




/* Example 4: Destructor function is called because the object might perform 
                some operation that must be undone when it goes out of scope.  
                Notice following Example
*/

#include <iostream>

class samp { 
        int i;
    public:
        samp(int n){      // constructor
            i=n;   
            std::cout << " Constructing \n"; 
        }
        ~samp(){          // destructor
            std::cout << " Destructing \n"; 
        }
   		int get_i(){ return i; }
};


// Return square of obj.i.
int sqr_it(samp obj){ 
    return obj.get_i() * obj.get_i(); 
}
    

int main(){
    samp a(10);

    std::cout << sqr_it(a) << "\n";

    return 0; 
}
 
/* Output : 	
        Constructing
        100
        Destructing
        Destructing 


    Notice only one call to the constructor function is made. 
        This occurs when a is created. 

    However, two calls to the destructor are made. 
        One is for the "copy" created when "object a" is passed to sqr_it(). 
        The other is for "object a itself".
*/




/*  ----------------    problem of execution of "copy's destructor function"    ----------------
    When an object is passed to a function, a "copy of that object" is made. 
        Further, when that function returns, the "copy's destructor function" is called. 

    However the execution of "copy's destructor function" can creates some sort-of problems. 
        For example, if the object used as the argument 
            "allocates dynamic memory when created" and 
            "frees that memory when destroyed", 
        its copy will free the same memory when its destructor is called. 
        This will leave the original object DAMAGED and effectively USELESS. 


    Resolve it 2 ways:
            1. using REFERENCE. 
            2. using copy-constructor
        This problem can be resolved in two ways : one, using reference. Two, using copy-constructor.

        One way around the problem of a - "parameterâ€™s destructor function destroying data needed by the calling argument" is 
            to pass the address of the object and not the object itself (making REFERENCE). 
            When an 'ADDRESS' is passed, no new object is created, 
            and therefore, no destructor is called when the function returns

        Another way is to use a COPY-CONSTRUCTOR
            It's a special type of constructor that lets you define precisely how copies of objects are made.
