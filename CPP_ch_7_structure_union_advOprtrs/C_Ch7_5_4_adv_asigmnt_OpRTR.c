7.8.3 More Uses Of Assignment Operator : You can assign several variables the same value using the general form
var _1 = var_2 = var_3 = ... = var_n = value ;
For example,   i = j = k = 100; assigns i, j, and k the value 100.  Professional programmers use such multiple-variable assignments.

Shorthand operators using "=" :  Another variation on the assignment statement is sometimes called C shorthand. In C, you can transform a statement like 	a = a + 3; into a statement like 	a += 3;
In general, any time you have a statement of the form	var = var op expression;
you can write it in shorthand form as 	var   = op  expression;	Here, op is one of   +  -  *  /  %  << >>  &  |  ^ .

Note : There must be no space between the operator and the equal sign.
