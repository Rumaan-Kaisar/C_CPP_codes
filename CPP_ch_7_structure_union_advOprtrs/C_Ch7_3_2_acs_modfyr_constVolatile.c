    ---------------    Access modifiers : const and volatile    ---------------
    Modifiers const and volatile affect the way variables are accessed by both your 'program' and the 'compiler'

    const : 
        precede a variable's type with 'const', you PREVENT that variable from 'being modified by your program'.
        It can be given an initial value when it is declared.
        The compiler is free to locate const variables in ROM (read-only memory) in environments that support it.
        

    volatile : 
        When you precede a variable's type with volatile, 
            you are telling the COMPILER that the 'value' may be changed in ways not 'explicitly defined' in the program. 
        
        For example, a variable's ADDRESS might be given to an 'interrupt service routine', and 
            its value changed each time an interrupt occurs.
*/




/* Example 1: The following short program shows how a 'const' variable can be given an 'INITIAL VALUE' 
                and be used in the program, as long as it is not on the left side of an assignment statement .

/*
    -----------    const pointer parameters    -----------

    The const modifier can 'prevent' a function from modifying the 'object' that a 'parameter points to'. 
    i.e. when a 'pointer parameter' is preceded by const, 
        'no statement in the function' can modify the variable pointed to by that parameter.

    The most important feature of 'const pointer parameters' is that 
        they guarantee that many Standared Library functions will not modify the variables pointed to by their parameters.

    For example, here is the actual prototype to strlen() specified by the ANSI standard:
                    size_t sll1en(const char *str);
        Since 'str' is specified as conat, 'the string it points to' cannot be changed.
*/
