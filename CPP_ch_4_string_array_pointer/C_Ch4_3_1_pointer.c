
chapter covers one of C's most important and sometimes
most troublesome features: the pointer. A pointer is basically
the address of an object. One reason that pointers are so
important is that much of the power of the C language is
derived from the unique way in which they are implemented.
You will learn about the special pointer operators, pointer arithmetic,
and how arrays and pointers are related. Also, you will be introduced
to using pointers as parameters to functions.
