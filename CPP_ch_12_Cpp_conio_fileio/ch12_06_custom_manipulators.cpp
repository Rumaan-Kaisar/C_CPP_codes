    Manipulators are special functions used with input/output streams (cin, cout).
    They help format data or perform repeated stream operations easily.


    Custom manipulators are important for two main reasons. 

    Combine repeated I/O steps:
        A custom manipulator can group several separate I/O operations that occur often in a program, 
        so we can perform them with a single command.

    Handle special devices:
        A custom manipulator allows us to perform I/O with "nonstandard devices" -
        for example, sending control codes to special hardware like printers or optical recognition systems.


    --------  Types of Manipulators  --------
    There are two basic types of manipulators: 
        Input stream manipulators (work with cin)
        Output stream manipulators (work with cout)

    There is a secondary division: 
        Parameterized manipulators
            Example: setw(10)
            
            Creating Parameterized manipulators is different across compilers, and 
            the steps are not consistent.
            So, for now, we will not cover how to create parameterized manipulators.

        Parameterless manipulators:
            Example: endl, flush
            (Easy and consistent across compilers.)



    --------  parameterless manipulators  --------
    
    The creation of parameterless manipulators is straightforward and the same for all compilers. 
    These follow a standard function format and always:
        Take a reference to the stream they operate on
        Return that same stream reference, allows chaining like:

                cout << manip1 << manip2;


    OUTPUT Manipulator Skeleton:
        All parameterless Output Manipulator Functions (used with 'cout') have this skeleton:

                ostream &manip_name( ostream &stream ) {
                    // your code here
                    return stream;
                }

            Here manip_name is the name of the manipulator and stream "&stream" is a reference to 
                the "invoking stream" which must be returned by the manipulator "return stream;".  
                This is necessary if a manipulator is used as part of a larger I/O expression. 

            Here the manipulator has a single argument "a reference to the stream upon which it is operating", 
                but no argument will be used when the manipulator is called in an output operation.


    INPUT Manipulator Skeleton:
        All parameterless Input Manipulator Functions (used with 'cin') have this skeleton:

                istream &manip_name( istream &stream ) {
                    // your code here
                    return stream;
                }

            An input manipulator receives a reference to the stream on which it was invoked. 
            This stream must be returned by the manipulator.


    The key point:
        The stream must be returned so it can continue to be used in a longer input/output expression.

                    field width to 10,

                    fill character to *.
