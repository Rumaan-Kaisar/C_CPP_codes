    It is possible to output information in a wide variety of forms using C++'s I/O system 
        as we did before with  C's printf() function


    C++ Format Flags (like printf in C):
        C++ streams (like 'cout') have "format flags" that control how output looks.
        You can think of them as switches that you can turn 'on' or 'off' to change the output format.
        These flags are part of the "ios" class and are grouped under a bitmask enumeration called "fmtflags".


    These values are defined "fmtflags":
        adjustfield
        basefield
        boolalpha
        dec
        fixed
        floatfield
        hex
        internal
        left
        oct
        right
        scientific
        showbase
        showpoint
        showpos
        skipws
        unitbuf
        uppercase

ÔÅÜ	These values are used to set or clear the format flags and are defined within ios. 





ÔÇõ	skipws: When the skipws flag is set, whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines) will be cleared for new input. When skipws is cleared, whitespace characters are not discarded.	


ÔÇõ	left, right, internal (for justified output): Default is right.
ÔÉ∞	left and right flags make, left and right justified output.
ÔÉ∞	internal flag makes a numeric value is padded to fill a field by inserting spaces between sign/base character. 


ÔÇõ	Dec, oct, hex : Decimal output is default
ÔÉ∞	oct and hex flags produce octal and hexadecimal output respectively. 
ÔÉ∞	To return output to decimal, set the dec flag.	

ÔÇõ	showbase displays the base of numeric values. Eg. for hexadecimal conversion, 1F will be displayed as 0x1F.
ÔÇõ	By default, the scientific notation "e" and hexadecimal notation "x" is displayed in lowercase, setting uppercase flag displays these characters in uppercase.
ÔÇõ	scientific, fixed: If the scientific flag produce floating-point values using scientific notation. And fixed flag makes scientific-notation disabled, and normal notation returned.	

ÔÇõ	showpos flag displays "+" before positive values.
ÔÇõ	showpoint flag display ".000000" for all floating-point output-whether needed or not.
ÔÉ∞	When neither flag is set, the compiler chooses an appropriate method.


ÔÇõ	Booleans can be input or output using the keywords true and false, when boolalpha is set.

ÔÇõ	unitbuf flushes the buffer after each insertion operation.	
ÔÉò	basefield: the oct, dec, and hex fields can be collectively referred as basefield. 
ÔÉò	adjustfield: the left, right, and internal fields collectively referred as adjustfield.
ÔÉò	floatfield: the scientific and fixed fields collectively referenced as floatfield.

Of course. Here is a simplified version of the provided text, organized into a clear and easy-to-understand format.

Simplified Guide to C++ I/O Formatting Flags
C++ uses formatting flags to control how data is displayed. You can think of them as switches that you can turn on or off to change the output format.

1. Number Base
dec (Default): Displays numbers in base 10 (e.g., 255).
hex: Displays numbers in base 16 (e.g., ff).
oct: Displays numbers in base 8 (e.g., 377).
showbase: Shows the base prefix (e.g., 0xff for hex, 0377 for oct).
2. Floating-Point Numbers
scientific: Uses scientific notation (e.g., 1.5e+10).
fixed: Uses standard decimal notation (e.g., 15000000000.000000).
showpoint: Always shows the decimal point, even for whole numbers (e.g., 10.0 instead of 10).
uppercase: Uses uppercase letters in scientific/hex notation (e.g., 1.5E+10, 0XFF).
3. Justification (Alignment)
right (Default): Aligns text to the right in a field (e.g., "    10").
left: Aligns text to the left in a field (e.g., "10    ").
internal: Pads the inside of a number, between the sign and the value (e.g., "+   10").
4. Number Sign
showpos: Displays a + sign for positive numbers (e.g., +10 instead of 10).
5. Boolean Values
boolalpha: Displays true and false as words instead of 1 and 0.
6. Input Behavior
skipws: (Default) Ignores leading whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) during input.
7. Buffer Control
unitbuf: Flushes the output buffer after every single operation, ensuring data is written immediately.
Flag Groups (Bitmask)
Some flags work together as groups. When you set a group, you clear all other flags in that same group.

basefield: The group for number base (dec, hex, oct).
adjustfield: The group for justification (left, right, internal).
floatfield: The group for floating-point notation (scientific, fixed).

üßæ C++ Format Flags (like printf() in C)
C++ streams (like cout) have format flags that control how output looks.
These flags are part of the ios class and are grouped under an enum called fmtflags.

üìå Format Flag Groups
Group	Flags
basefield	dec, oct, hex
adjustfield	left, right, internal
floatfield	fixed, scientific

üîπ Flag Descriptions
Whitespace handling:

skipws (default ON): skips spaces, tabs, newlines during input

Turn it OFF to read whitespace as input

Output alignment (justification):

left ‚Üí left-justified output

right (default) ‚Üí right-justified

internal ‚Üí pads numeric output between sign/base (e.g., - 123)

Number base:

dec ‚Üí decimal (default)

oct ‚Üí octal (e.g., 075)

hex ‚Üí hexadecimal (e.g., 0x1F)

showbase ‚Üí shows base prefix (e.g., 0x for hex)

Floating-point format:

scientific ‚Üí outputs in scientific notation (e.g., 1.23e+03)

fixed ‚Üí disables scientific form, shows normal decimal

showpoint ‚Üí always shows decimal point (e.g., 5.000000)

Signs and casing:

showpos ‚Üí shows + sign for positive numbers

uppercase ‚Üí displays E (not e) in scientific, X in hex

Boolean formatting:

boolalpha ‚Üí displays true/false instead of 1/0

Buffer behavior:

unitbuf ‚Üí forces output to flush after every insertion

üß† Notes:
Flags can be combined, set, or cleared using stream member functions like setf(), unsetf(), or manipulators like std::hex.

These flags affect how data is displayed or input through streams like cin, cout, etc.

Let me know if you want a code example demonstrating each of these.



-----------------------


ÔÅ≤	To set a format flag, use the setf() function which is a member of ios. Its form is:       fmtflags setf (fmtflags flags);
ÔÅÜ	This function returns the previous settings of the format flags and turns on those flags specified by flags. (All other flags are unaffected.)  For example, to turn on the showpos flag:
stream.setf ( ios :: showpos );
ÔÉñ	Here stream is the stream that you wish to affect. 
ÔÉñ	Notice the use of the scope resolution operator (::). Because the format flags are defined within the ios class, you must access their values by using ios and the scope resolution operator. 
ÔÅÜ	setf() is a member function of the ios class and affects streams created by that class. 
ÔÉ∞	Therefore, any call to setf() is done relative to a specific stream.
ÔÉ∞	setf() cannot be called by itself 
ÔÉ∞	There is no concept in C++ of global format status. Each stream maintains its own format status information individually.
ÔÅÜ	To set more than one flag in a single call to setf(): use "OR" together the values of the flags. For example, this call sets the showbase and hex flags for cout:
cout.setf( ios :: showbase | ios :: hex );
ÔÅÜ	Note: showpos, showbase, hex all are enumerated constants within the ios class. Therefore, it is necessary to tell the compiler this fact by preceding showpos/showbase/hex with the class name "ios" and the scope resolution operator "::". Otherwise showpos/showbase/hex will not be recognized. We must specify  ios::showpos or ios::showbase or ios::hex.



ÔÅ≤	The complement of setf() is unsetf().This member function of ios clears one or more format flags. Its prototype form is:
void unsetf ( fmtflags flags );
ÔÅÜ	The flags specified by flags are cleared. (All other flags are unaffected.)
ÔÅ≤	To know the current format settings without altering: Use the special member function of ios, flags(), which simply returns the current setting for each format flag. Its prototype is:   fmtflags flags();
ÔÅÜ	The flags() also allows to set/reset all format flags associated with a stream to those specified in the argument to flags(). The prototype for this version of flags() is:
fmtflags flags ( fmtflags f);
ÔÉ∞	For this version, the bit pattern found in f is copied to the variable used to hold the format flags associated with the stream, and overwrites all previous flag settings. The function returns the previous settings.

üéØ Setting and Managing Format Flags in C++
üîπ 1. Setting Format Flags with setf()
Syntax:

cpp
Copy
Edit
fmtflags setf(fmtflags flags);
Purpose: Sets one or more format flags for a specific stream

Returns the previous flag settings

Does not affect flags that are not mentioned

Example:

cpp
Copy
Edit
stream.setf(ios::showpos);  // turns on showpos for the stream
Important Notes:

setf() must be called on a specific stream like cout, cin, etc.

Flags like showpos, hex are part of the ios class, so you must use ios::flagname

No global format state in C++ ‚Äî each stream maintains its own format settings

Setting Multiple Flags Together:

cpp
Copy
Edit
cout.setf(ios::showbase | ios::hex);
üîπ 2. Clearing Flags with unsetf()
Syntax:

cpp
Copy
Edit
void unsetf(fmtflags flags);
Purpose: Clears (turns off) one or more specified format flags

Other flags remain unchanged

Example:

cpp
Copy
Edit
cout.unsetf(ios::hex);  // turns off hex format
üîπ 3. Reading / Replacing All Format Flags with flags()
To Read Current Settings:

cpp
Copy
Edit
fmtflags current = stream.flags();
To Set All Flags at Once:

cpp
Copy
Edit
stream.flags(ios::dec | ios::showpos);  // replaces all existing flags
Returns: the old settings before the change

‚úÖ Summary:
Function	Use
setf()	Set specific format flags
unsetf()	Clear specific format flags
flags()	Read or replace all flag bits

Let me know if you'd like a small C++ program using all three (setf, unsetf, flags).

ÔÅÜ	This program displays: 	1.232300e+02 hello  64 	    a  fffffff6 	+100.000000
ÔÉ∞	Here showpos flag affects only decimal output (i.e. a  fffffff6 is unaffected). It does not affect the value 10 when output in hexadecimal. 
ÔÉ∞	Also notice the unsetf() call that turns off the dec flag (which is on by default). It is necessary to turn it off when turning on either hex or oct. In general, it is better to set only the number base that you want to use and clear the others.
