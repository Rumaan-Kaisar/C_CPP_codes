
/*  ------------------------    Formatted I/O    ------------------------

    It is possible to output information in a wide variety of forms using C++'s I/O system 
        as we did before with  C's printf() function


    C++ Format Flags (like printf in C):
        C++ streams (like 'cout') have "format flags" that control how output looks.
        You can think of them as switches that you can turn 'on' or 'off' to change the output format.
        These flags are part of the "ios" class and are grouped under a bitmask enumeration called "fmtflags".


    These values are used to set or clear the format flags and are defined within ios.

        adjustfield
        basefield
        boolalpha
        dec
        fixed
        floatfield
        hex
        internal
        left
        oct
        right
        scientific
        showbase
        showpoint
        showpos
        skipws
        unitbuf
        uppercase



    Whitespace handling:
        skipws:         When the skipws flag is set, whitespace characters 
                        (spaces, tabs, and newlines) will be cleared for new input. 
                        (default ON)
                        When skipws is cleared, whitespace characters are not discarded.	


    Justification (Alignment): 
        Default is "right".
        left, right:    flags make- left and right justified output (e.g., "    10" or "10    ").
        internal:       Pads the inside of a number, between the sign and the value (e.g., "+   10").


    Number Base
        dec (Default):  Displays numbers in base 10 (e.g., 255).
        oct, hex:       produce octal and hexadecimal output respectively. 
        
        To return output to decimal, set the dec flag.

        showbase: Shows the base prefix (e.g., 0xff for hex, 0377 for oct).


    Boolean Values
        boolalpha:      Displays true and false as words instead of 1 and 0.
        
        Booleans can be input or output using the keywords true and false, when boolalpha is set.


    Floating-Point Numbers:
        scientific:     Uses scientific notation (e.g., 1.5e+10).
        fixed:          Uses standard decimal notation (e.g., 15000000000.000000).
        showpoint:      Always shows the decimal point ".000000", even for whole numbers (e.g., 10.0 instead of 10).
        uppercase:      Uses uppercase letters (E, not e) in scientific/hex notation (e.g., 1.5E+10, 0XFF).

        By default, the scientific notation "e" and hexadecimal notation "x" is displayed in lowercase, 
        setting uppercase flag displays these characters in uppercase.
        When neither flag is set, the compiler chooses an appropriate method.


    Number Sign
        showpos:        Displays a + sign for positive numbers (e.g., +10 instead of 10).


    Buffer Control
        unitbuf:        Flushes the output buffer after each insertion operation.
                        Ensures data is written immediately.



    --------  Format Flag Groups  --------
    Some flags work together as groups. When you set a group, you clear all other flags in that same group.

        basefield:      The group for number base (dec, hex, oct).
        adjustfield:    The group for justification (left, right, internal).
        floatfield:     The group for floating-point notation (scientific, fixed).


        Group           Flags
        --------------------------------------
        basefield       dec, oct, hex
        adjustfield     left, right, internal
        floatfield      fixed, scientific


    Notes:
        Flags can be combined, set, or cleared using stream member functions like 
        setf(), unsetf(), or manipulators like std::hex.

        These flags affect how data is displayed or input through streams like cin, cout, etc.



    ----------------    set a format flag    ----------------
    setf():
        To set a format flag, use the setf() function which is a member of ios.

        Its form is:
                        fmtflags setf( fmtflags flags );

            Sets one or more format flags for a specific stream
            This function returns the previous settings of the format flags and 
            turns "on" those flags specified by "flags". 
            (All other flags are unaffected. Does not affect flags that are not mentioned)  


            For example, to turn on the showpos flag:

                        stream.setf( ios :: showpos );  // turns on showpos for the stream

                Here "stream" is the stream that you wish to affect. 

                Notice the use of the scope resolution operator (::). 
                    Because the format flags are defined within the "ios" class, 
                    you must access their values by using "ios" and the scope resolution operator. 


        setf() is a member function of the "ios" class and affects streams created by that class. 
            Therefore, any call to setf() is done relative to a specific stream.
            setf() cannot be called by itself 

            There is no concept in C++ of global format status. 
            Each stream maintains its own format status information individually.



----  rev[08-Aug-2025]  ----

ÔÅÜ	To set more than one flag in a single call to setf(): use "OR" together the values of the flags. For example, this call sets the showbase and hex flags for cout:
cout.setf( ios :: showbase | ios :: hex );



ÔÅÜ	Note: showpos, showbase, hex all are enumerated constants within the ios class. Therefore, it is necessary to tell the compiler this fact by preceding showpos/showbase/hex with the class name "ios" and the scope resolution operator "::". Otherwise showpos/showbase/hex will not be recognized. We must specify  ios::showpos or ios::showbase or ios::hex.



ÔÅ≤	The complement of setf() is unsetf().This member function of ios clears one or more format flags. Its prototype form is:
void unsetf ( fmtflags flags );
ÔÅÜ	The flags specified by flags are cleared. (All other flags are unaffected.)



ÔÅ≤	To know the current format settings without altering: Use the special member function of ios, flags(), which simply returns the current setting for each format flag. Its prototype is:   fmtflags flags();
ÔÅÜ	The flags() also allows to set/reset all format flags associated with a stream to those specified in the argument to flags(). The prototype for this version of flags() is:
fmtflags flags ( fmtflags f);
ÔÉ∞	For this version, the bit pattern found in f is copied to the variable used to hold the format flags associated with the stream, and overwrites all previous flag settings. The function returns the previous settings.



-----------------------

Important Notes:

setf() must be called on a specific stream like cout, cin, etc.

Flags like showpos, hex are part of the ios class, so you must use ios::flagname

No global format state in C++ ‚Äî each stream maintains its own format settings

Setting Multiple Flags Together:

cpp
Copy
Edit
cout.setf(ios::showbase | ios::hex);
üîπ 2. Clearing Flags with unsetf()
Syntax:

cpp
Copy
Edit
void unsetf(fmtflags flags);
Purpose: Clears (turns off) one or more specified format flags

Other flags remain unchanged

Example:

cpp
Copy
Edit
cout.unsetf(ios::hex);  // turns off hex format
üîπ 3. Reading / Replacing All Format Flags with flags()
To Read Current Settings:

cpp
Copy
Edit
fmtflags current = stream.flags();
To Set All Flags at Once:

cpp
Copy
Edit
stream.flags(ios::dec | ios::showpos);  // replaces all existing flags
Returns: the old settings before the change

‚úÖ Summary:
Function	Use
setf()	Set specific format flags
unsetf()	Clear specific format flags
flags()	Read or replace all flag bits

Let me know if you'd like a small C++ program using all three (setf, unsetf, flags).

/* Example 1:    following program shows how to set several flags. 


ÔÅÜ	This program displays: 	1.232300e+02 hello  64 	    a  fffffff6 	+100.000000
ÔÉ∞	Here showpos flag affects only decimal output (i.e. a  fffffff6 is unaffected). It does not affect the value 10 when output in hexadecimal. 
ÔÉ∞	Also notice the unsetf() call that turns off the dec flag (which is on by default). It is necessary to turn it off when turning on either hex or oct. In general, it is better to set only the number base that you want to use and clear the others.
