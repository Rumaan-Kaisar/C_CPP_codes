First, you can use the standard, C-like comment mechanism. 
    That is, begin a comment with /* and end it with */. 
    As with C, this type of comment cannot be nested in C++.

The second way that you can add a remark to your C++ program is to use the single-line comment. 
    A single-line comment begins with a // and stops at the end of the line. 

Typically, C++ programmers use 'C-like comments' for "multiline commentaries" and 
    reserve C++ style single line comments for "short remarks".
